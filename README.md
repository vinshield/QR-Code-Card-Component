## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used the flex-gap property for the first time. It ensures that all the components added to the text section of the card in the future will have equal spacing between them. 

I practiced vertically and horizontally centering elements using flexbox. 

I used the width and max-width properties together to ensure that the card looks good on every screen size without having to use media queries. 

### Continued development

In the future, I would like to focus on creating responsive web pages while using as few media queries as possible. 

### Useful resources

- CSS Tricks (https://css-tricks.com/centering-css-complete-guide/) - CSS Tricks provided a very easy to understand guide for centering elements. Their articles are well written in general.
